I love scripts. Let's tell beginners how to run this.
First copy the script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiolepore/ChristBASHTree/master/tree-EN.sh

Paste the script into your favorite text editor. Name it anything; example here - christmas.sh

To make it executable

sudo  chmod +x filename.extension

With the example

sudo chmod +x christmas.sh

Now run this command to executable the script


./christmas.sh

Merry Christmas to all and Happy Scripting.
